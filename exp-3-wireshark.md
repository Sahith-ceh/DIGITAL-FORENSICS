# Experiment 3 â€“ Wireshark

**Objective:**  
To capture, filter, and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.

---

## Description  
Wireshark is a widely used open-source network protocol analyzer.  
It allows investigators to capture and interactively browse traffic running on a computer network.  

With Wireshark, forensic analysts can:  
- Capture live network packets.  
- Apply filters to isolate protocols such as HTTP, DNS, or TCP.  
- Analyze suspicious communication patterns.  
- Export captured traffic for reporting.  

It is especially useful in network forensics to identify malicious traffic, detect intrusions, and reconstruct communication sessions.
